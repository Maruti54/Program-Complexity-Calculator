# Time and Space Complexity Finder
Time and space complexity finder in Big O format

For certain programming tasks, there are different algorithms available. Some of them are efficient in time or some of them are efficient in space. All these algorithms contribute different time and space complexity. It depends on the input also. Usually, if the time complexity is minimum then it may exceed the space complexity and vice versa. So if we have multiple solutions for a certain problem we should look into time and space complexity in order to check efficiency of the algorithm. It’s quite hard to decide the perfect algorithm for our task without analyzing its time and space complexity.

Our project aims to solve this problem by implementing a system which will help to find time and space complexity for a given algorithm. Users will have to paste the algorithm in the given file which will have a .py extension. And thus this algorithm will work only for python modules. Users can only check python function time complexities. After pasting it there, the system will analyze it and display the time complexity in big O notation. for eg. O(1), O(N^1), O(N^2). It will also display the space complexity in terms of memory used by each variable or memory container or any kind of data structure used in the algorithm. It will be in ‘bytes’. At last, it will sum up all the memory used by each of these and display it as an overall memory used by the algorithm.
